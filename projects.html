      <!--<h3>How Do I Learn To Code.com</h3>
      <p>After being asked 'how do I learn to code?' more times than I can remember, I made a web app to answer the question.</p>
      <p>Instead of starting with <em>'how'</em>, we start with <em>'why'</em> to filter through all the noise and figure out the best learning to code resources based on your needs.</p>
      <p>I built it in React, so I could learn something new whilst helping others to. Well, that, and it was more fun...</p>

      <h3>London Tech Meetups</h3>
      <a href="http://londontechmeetups.com"><img src="images/ltmtwittericon.png" alt="London skyline London Tech Meetups icon"></a>
      <p><a href="http://londontechmeetups.com">London Tech Meetups</a> is an open-source list of London tech meetups, categorised by languages, technologies, groups for beginners, and for underrepresented groups.</p>
      <p>Realising I was writing this list again and again for my <a href="http://codefirstgirls.org.uk">Code First: Girls</a> classes and other mentoring groups, I put together a more comprehensive list, open to contributions.</p>
      <p>For more current announcements, there's <a href="https://twitter.com/ldntechmeetups">@ldntechmeetups</a> on Twitter, and you can make suggestions by <a href="https://github.com/londontechmeetups/londontechmeetups.github.io">submitting a pull request to the GitHub repository</a>.</p>

      <h3>Unbias</h3>
      <a href="http://unbias.io"><img src="images/unbias.png" alt="Unbias Chrome Extension to reduce unconscious bias by anonymising LinkedIn"></a>
      <p>A Chrome extension to remove faces and names in LinkedIn profiles and searches, to <a href="http://unbias.io/#why">reduce the effects of unconscious bias on recruiters</a>.</p>
      <p>Recruiters use LinkedIn to find, shortlist and contact candidates. As LinkedIn displays both names and profile photos, recruiters are susceptible to unconscious bias. It may affect whether or not they choose to shortlist or contact a candidate, outside of the relevant facts about that candidate.</p>
      <p>Unbias removes names and photos, in both standard and recruiter account searches and profile views, to help reduce the effects of unconscious bias. <a href="http://unbias.io">Find out more about Unbias.</a></p>

      <img src="images/cfgconference.jpg" alt="Jenny Brennan chairing panel discussion at Code First Girls conference">
      <p>I'm an instructor and long-time supporter of <a href="http://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/">Code First: Girls</a>. Code First: Girls works with companies, as well as young and professional women, to help increase the number of women in tech.</p>
      <p>I teach the Beginner Web Development course, covering HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and some JQuery.</p>
      <p>I'm also a big fan of the Code First: Girls community, and was recently asked to moderate the keynote panel at the Code First: Girls conference, entitled 'How to Switch into Tech and Entrepreneurship'.</p>

      <p>I co-founded <a href="http://codelaborate.org" title="Codelaborate for self taught coders">Codelaborate</a> in 2014 to help self-taught coders at university meet up, learn from each other and work on awesome stuff together.</p>
      <p>We&#39;re about bringing people together to build apps, websites, anything. We host weekly coding meetups, as well as talks, including speakers from Facebook, Google and Codecademy. </p>
      <p>We&#39;ve obtained sponsorship from <a href="http://joinef.com" title="Entrepreneur First">EF</a>, <a href="https://gocardless.com/" title="GoCardless payment">GoCardless</a>, <a href="http://decoded.co/uk/" title="Decoded Digital Enlightenment">Decoded</a>, <a href="http://opensignal.com/" title="OpenSignal app">OpenSignal</a> and <a href="http://playfaircapital.com/" title="Playfair Capital technology investor">Playfair Capital</a>. Codelaborate is still running at Oxford University, with interest from other universities in starting there. You can hear about the next meetup on our <a href="">Facebook page</a>.</p>
