## A note on reading more

[Matt Clifford](https://medium.com/@matthewclifford/what-i-read-in-2018-9108385ccb6b) and [Nadia Odunayo](https://medium.com/@nodunayo/what-i-read-in-2018-2eb91511c656) both write great annual reading lists. They have both inspired me in book choice and in publishing what I've enjoyed, but also to be more ambitious in how much I read. Here are a few ways I found to help me read more:

* Measure what you want to improve: keep an annual list of what you've read.
* Making time by making a habit - replacing mindless timeline scrolling and Netflix by putting the book/Kindle somewhere accessible, and take app icons off my home screen.
* Put something down if it's knocking the habit - I paused a couple of great books (A History of Seven Killings, Destined for War); they've been easier to pick up again later, now the habit's more cemented.
* Gamify - I mainly read on Kindle with "percentage of the way through" and "time left in book" indicators as motivation.
