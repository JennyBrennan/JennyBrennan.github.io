> “Hi. We need to talk about **sanitary bins**.”

Not a common opening line.

Not a common first conversation with a man you’ve never met before, in fact.

But there I was, stood at the office reception.

You see, there’s fresh sliced fruit in the water tank, beer on tap and a ping pong table — but no sanitary bins in the loos.

The offices are great, and the frontdesk team were diligently trying to solve a mixup with building administration.

**But when free mouthwash arrived in the bathrooms, I snapped.**

You see, office spaces have a problem with periods. My simple mission had just been to get a sanitary bin in the office before I had my period (that failed). It was an unusual case.

But what is still true: a [billion-dollar office space startup](https://www.wework.com/) pays people to slice fruit into water and now provides free mouthwash in the bathrooms, but doesn’t leave any tampons in them.

## We’ve got some strange priorities.

I don’t need fruit in my water. I don’t need beer on tap. But if I’m bleeding, I need a sanitary product. The number of offices in London I’ve seen freely offering the former (or equivalent) before the latter, is kind of strange.

## “But people around the world remember to bring their own — you’re a grown adult!”

Yes. But you could bring your own mouthwash too. What companies are saying is “we know that bad breath can make you, or even a client, feel uncomfortable, so it’s a worthwhile investment to provide this for you, in case you forgot your own solution”. Sanitary products are a similar investment in employee productivity and, I’d argue, a much higher priority one [^1].

## It’s easily solved.

A [number](http://facebook.com) [of top](http://twitter.com) [tech firms](http://google.com) now provide sanitary products, free of charge, in their bathrooms.

[Tampon.club](http://www.tampon.club/) calculated the cost of doing so at [**£4.28 per menstruating individual per year**](http://www.tampon.club/tampon-club-for-folks-who-dont-use-tampons/provide-free-tampons/#how-much-will-it-cost). I’d estimate the cost of sliced fruit in all the water tanks of one 5 floor swanky shared office building at £6.90 a day (they put lychees in the water one day — lychees!) [^2]. 260 days a year. I’d hazard a guess that a number of such offices in London don’t yet have 260 menstruating individuals in them. **Sanitary products are a good deal.** If you don’t see fruit in the water, you don’t have to waste office time going out to the shops to get some, or quietly ask a colleague to lend you a lime [^3].

And **the services exist**. Companies like [Sanitary Owl](https://www.sanitaryowl.com) in the UK, or [Hello Flo](https://helloflo.com/) in the US, provide monthly home delivery packages, and the latter already [provides for a number of US startups](http://mic.com/articles/86819/if-men-had-their-period-would-tampons-in-your-office-be-free).

## Happy bleeding resources:

In my accidental side-job as a bathroom campaigner [^4], I have come across:

*   [Tampon Club](http://www.tampon.club/) — resources to help you convince your boss, or provide a community solution instead
*   [Free The Tampons](http://freethetampons.org/) — if you want to take this a step further and make them free in all public bathrooms
*   [Don't Let Them See Your Tampons](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/06/dont-let-them-see-your-tampons/394376/) — a fun piece on how awkward we often are about hiding sanitary products

(feel free to [tweet further resources my way](http://twitter.com/jennyhbren) and I’ll add them here)


[^1]: **If it’s unclear why sanitary products help employee productivity:** some people do not have regular periods, so might not be able to anticipate when they need to take a product to the bathroom. Sometimes humans are just forgetful or busy. Walking back to the office to get said product is both time consuming and awkward. Walking to a shop because you don’t have one in the office and don’t know anyone to lend you what you need is even more time consuming. Plus, you’re still bleeding. A large portion of the working population will encounter this issue. Whilst this is also true for bad breath and bad breath is considered socially awkward, bleeding visibly is generally a complete taboo in an office so has a higher cost (plus there’s usually no social anxiety around asking for mint gum in an office, and plenty of people who could offer it to you).

[^2]: Each tank: 2 * [24p oranges](http://www.mysupermarket.co.uk/Shopping/FindProducts.aspx?Query=orange), 2 x [30p lemons](http://www.mysupermarket.co.uk/grocery-categories/Lemons_in_Tesco.html) 1 x [30p lime](http://www.mysupermarket.co.uk/Shopping/FindProducts.aspx?Query=lime) = £1.38\. Multiplied by 5 tanks in the office (one for each floor) = **£6.90**. I have a suspicion they might have added fruit more than once a day, but, equally, they also might have bought it cheaper as regular/wholesale purchasers, so this seems a fair estimate. They also sometimes used watermelon ([£2.50 a pop](http://www.mysupermarket.co.uk/tesco-price-comparison/Fruit/Tesco_Watermelon.html)). And yes, the water was damn tasty.

[^3]: Bonus points if you then discover no one else in your team has ever needed a lime. Then you get to ask a stranger for one. True story.

[^4]: You think I joke. Seriously, why don’t all public bathrooms have [foot step door openers](http://www.stepnpull.com/)? And why have we [never listened to Finland on the way bathroom doors open](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5025270)?
