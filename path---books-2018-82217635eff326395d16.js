At least, versus some of the lists that inspired both my reading this year, and documenting it more thoroughly (HT to Matt Clifford, Nadia Odunayo). </p>\n<p>Why publish?\nI enjoy lists, someone might enjoy mine\nSatisfying to record</p>\n<p>How to read more?\nMeasure what you want to improve\nMaking time by making a habit - replacing mindless scrolling and Netflix\nPut something down if it’s knocking the habit; a couple of great books I started (<a href="">A History of Seven Killings</a>, <a href="">Destined for War</a>), but if it’s not keeping reading flowing, stop. I’ve been able to pick these up again later on, because the habit’s more cemented.</p>\n<h2>Non-fiction</h2>\n<h3>Top reads</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>World After Capital, Albert Wenger - draft. Great.</li>\n<li>Weapons of Math Destruction, Cathy O’Neil - a classic. Referenced like the Bible at Coed:ethics. </li>\n<li>Becoming, Michelle Obama - you know about this book already.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The rest</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Hatching Twitter, Nick Bilton - history of Twitter; culturally required reading context for working at Twitter; amusingly written more like a thriller than expected; unclear how accurate it is. </li>\n<li>The Undoing Project, Michael Lewis - biography of working relationship between Daniel Kahnman and Amos Tversky; wanted to love this because I love the subject matter, but the writing missed the mark.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fiction</h2>\n<p>TODO: ADD ALL THE LINKS</p>\n<h3>Top reads</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Power of the Sower, Octavia E. Butler - love. </li>\n<li>Station Eleven, Emily St. John Mandel - </li>\n<li>La Belle Sauvage, Phillip Pullman - like stepping back into a comfy old world. First half better than second. </li>\n<li>Pachinko, Min Jin Lee - beautifully captured. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The rest</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Murder on the Links - Agatha Christie</li>\n<li>Things Fall Apart - Chinua Achebe</li>\n<li>Purple Hibiscus - Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche</li>\n<li>The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle - Stuart Turton</li>\n<li>A friend’s novel (I can’t really say any more, I’m just too proud of this friend not to list it)</li>\n<li>The Girl in the Spider’s Web - David Lagercrantz</li>\n<li>The Casual Vacancy - J.K. Rowling</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Recommendations welcome</h2>\n<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jennyhbren">Tweet me</a>. </p>',frontmatter:{title:"Books 2018",date:"December 31, 2018",desc:"What and how I read in 2018."}}},pathContext:{slug:"/books-2018/",previous:{fields:{slug:"/crowdsourced-tech-resources/"},frontmatter:{title:"Crowdsourced Tech Resources"}},next:{fields:{slug:"/high-impact-climate-actions/"},frontmatter:{title:"Paper Straws are a Distraction"}}}}}});
