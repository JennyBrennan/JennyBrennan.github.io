If you're a software developer, and you don't have the option to focus on tackling the climate crisis full time, what are the best things you can do in your current role for the environment? 

Without action, ICT may [exceed 14% of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2040](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S095965261733233X).[^1]

## Data centre choice

Data centres are estimated to make up [45% of ICT's greenhouse gas emissions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S095965261733233X). That's thought to be [similar energy use as the entire aviation industry](https://www.notion.so/Environmental-actions-for-software-developers-bcf0155dde7d4ef88994e2db673515cf). Artist/researcher Joana Moll even visualised the [trees needed to absorb the CO2 emitted by visits to google.com every second](http://www.janavirgin.com/CO2/DEFOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOREST_about.html) (spoiler: it's a lot).

As a software developer, data centre choice is also likely the area you have most influence over. And some options are better than others:

> * "Enterprises choose 100% sustainable locations for new Cloud instances (e.g. use Azure, Google Cloud or the sustainable AWS regions of Dublin, Frankfurt, Oregon or Canada) and transition existing VMs there as soon as possible.
> * Enterprises inform their data center providers they want secure, sustainably-powered compute resources by 2024.
> * Individual technologists state their commitment by signing the [Sustainable Servers petition](https://www.change.org/p/sustainable-servers-by-2024)."

When starting a new project, choosing sustainable servers is likely your highest impact action. 

You can check whether your existing projects are powered by renewable energy at [The Green Web Foundation](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/).

## Efficiency

Writing efficient code, killing old services, remembering not to leave that job running. Business and environmental incentives often align here. But as compute gets cheaper, the pressure to keep server spending down might too.

If you're a data scientist, training ML models can be compute intensive, and compute is increasingly cheap. Researchers have suggested two approaches:

* Measure the carbon footprint of your model with [ML CO2 Impact](https://mlco2.github.io/impact/)
* Incentivise [Green AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10597) by making efficiency an evaluation criterion for research - aiming to make models greener and more inclusive/accessible with lower training compute requirements


## Employee action

At larger tech companies, you might not have as much individual influence over infrastructure. But folk at big tech companies have used collective action to bargain for better climate outcomes, such as the [#11at11ClimateStrike](https://twitter.com/hashtag/11at11ClimateStrike).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Building employee action: like user research, there points you can learn by starting:<br>1) What&#39;s your organisation&#39;s response?<br>2) What can you work on together?<br>3) What do people need to be able to act?<br><br>(These are great slides - hope they get shared!)<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClimateActionTech?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ClimateActionTech</a> <a href="https://t.co/NB4BMMEsMM">pic.twitter.com/NB4BMMEsMM</a></p>&mdash; Jenny Brennan (@jennyhbren) <a href="https://twitter.com/jennyhbren/status/1229495488216477696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 17, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Community wisdom

If you're keen to make change, it helps not to do it alone.

[ClimateAction.tech](http://climateaction.tech) community is a global online community of tech folks skills, expertise and platforms to support solutions to the climate crisis. They have an active international Slack and have also held in person meetups in London (pre-COVID).

## Software engineers are humans too

Once we've automated everyone else's jobs, we'll probably automate our own too. Until then, software engineers are humans, so the highest leverage climate actions for humans apply here too. I summarised [evidence-based climate actions for most people here]([https://jennybrennan.com/high-impact-climate-actions/](https://jennybrennan.com/high-impact-climate-actions/)). 

## What's missing?

If you think there's something missing, I'd love to hear on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jennyhbren).
