## Fostering an inclusive hiring process

These are resources I often recommend to help focus on different aspects of fostering an inclusive hiring process: from starting inside-out and considering your own team inclusivity, to reducing bias in job specs and hiring processes. Some are UK/London focussed as that's where I'm based. 

<p>I last updated this list in November 2018.</p>

## Inclusive team

*   [Project Include](http://projectinclude.org/) - recommendations for diversity and inclusion in startups
*   [Lever's diversity and inclusion resources](https://www.lever.co/diversity-and-inclusion) - Lever (US-based ATS startup of about 150 people) have an impressive 44% women engineers and wrote a series on how they approached this

## Job specs

*   [Textio](https://textio.com/) - improves job specs + gives you masculine-feminine tone analysis
*   [Gender Decoder for Job Ads](http://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/) - open source tool based on the Gaucher, Friesen & Kay study for identifying gender-coded language in job ads
*   [Tech Talent Charter](https://techtalentcharter.co.uk/) - UK-based commitment and guidelines around hiring and diversity

## Sourcing

*   [London Tech Meetups](http://londontechmeetups.com/#underrepresented) - an open source list of London meetups for underrepresented groups in tech (disclaimer: I started it)
*   [Ada's List](http://adaslist.co/) - worldwide community and mailinglist for women and non-binary people in tech
*   [hiremorewomenintech.com](http://hiremorewomenintech.com/) - has an incomplete list of meetups worldwide, and also places to post jobs (also has some tips on job specs and other resources)

## Hiring process

*   [Applied](https://www.beapplied.com/) - evidence-based application scoring system to avoid bias
*   [Unbias](http://unbias.io/) - try anonymising your LinkedIn searching (disclaimer: I built this)
* 	[Anonymise HackerRank](https://github.com/JennyBrennan/anonymise-hackerrank) - HackerRank is *not* my preference for a quality or inclusive candidate experience, but if you don't have a choice, I built this Chrome Extension to anonymise candidate submissions
