They have both inspired me in book choice and in publishing what I’ve enjoyed, but also to be more ambitious in how much I read. Here are a few ways I found to help me read more:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Measure what you want to improve: keep an annual list of what you’ve read.</li>\n<li>Making time by making a habit - replacing mindless timeline scrolling and Netflix by putting the book/Kindle somewhere accessible, and take app icons off my home screen.</li>\n<li>Put something down if it’s knocking the habit - I paused a couple of great books (A History of Seven Killings, Destined for War); they’ve been easier to pick up again later, now the habit’s more cemented.</li>\n<li>Gamify - I mainly read on Kindle with “percentage of the way through” and “time left in book” indicators as motivation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Nonfiction</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Automating Inequality, Virgina Eubanks</li>\n<li>Becoming, Michelle Obama</li>\n<li>Content Design, Sarah Richards</li>\n<li>Feynman, Jim Ottaviani &#x26; Leland Myrick (graphic nonfiction)</li>\n<li>Open Borders: the Science and Ethics of Immigration - Bryan Caplan &#x26; Zach Weinersmith (graphic nonfiction)</li>\n<li>Superior, Angela Saini</li>\n<li>World After Capital, Albert Wenger</li>\n<li>Weapons of Math Destruction, Cathy O’Neil</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fiction</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Parable of the Sower, Octavia E.
