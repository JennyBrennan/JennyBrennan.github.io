I’m still very much a beginner, but friends have asked for tips and the resources I used:</p>\n<h2>Picking a starter project</h2>\n<p>I’d suggest something simple to start with. To tell if it is simple: in general the closer it is to being a plain ball or oval shape, the easier it will be. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.hookedbyrobin.com/blog/2019/09/how-to-crochet-amigurumi-jellyfish.html\">this jellyfish</a> or a tiny chonky round whale.</p>\n<p>I started with <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/777667148/sea-animals-amigurumi-crochet-kit-bundle?ref=shop_home_active_2&#x26;frs=1&#x26;crt=1\">this sea animals crochet kit</a> from <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/beardieandblondie?ref=simple-shop-header-name&#x26;listing_id=777667148\">Beardie &#x26; Blondie on Etsy</a>. The patterns were easy enough for a first project, but I found the yarn (Ricorumi DK cotton) and hook (3.5mm) too small having never crocheted before. 4 hours in all I had was some tangled string. I ended up getting <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003D7UCJQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&#x26;psc=1\">bigger yarn</a> (Aran) and a <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.co.uk/Clover-Amour-Crochet-Hook-Multicoloured/dp/B008J140U8/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&#x26;keywords=5.5mm+crochet+hook&#x26;qid=1604159820&#x26;s=kitchen&#x26;sr=1-8\">5.5mm hook</a> instead and was then able to get the hang of it as I could see what I was doing better and it was less fiddly (I like to think the previous 4 hours of pain helped too). Once I’d made my first tiny whale with the bigger materials I found I was able to use the smaller yarn and hook just fine.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/3d4069744b600bd8595341dd29a472c8/1ab54/crochet-yarn-hook-size-whale-demonstration.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 56.75675675675676%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Bigger yarn and hook makes a bigger crocheted whale than the one made with the smaller yarn and hook - all of them have cute shiny bead eyes\"\n        title=\"Bigger yarn and hook makes a bigger crocheted whale than the one made with the smaller yarn and hook - all of them have cute shiny bead eyes\"\n        src=\"/static/3d4069744b600bd8595341dd29a472c8/1c72d/crochet-yarn-hook-size-whale-demonstration.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/3d4069744b600bd8595341dd29a472c8/a80bd/crochet-yarn-hook-size-whale-demonstration.jpg 148w,\n/static/3d4069744b600bd8595341dd29a472c8/1c91a/crochet-yarn-hook-size-whale-demonstration.jpg 295w,\n/static/3d4069744b600bd8595341dd29a472c8/1c72d/crochet-yarn-hook-size-whale-demonstration.jpg 590w,\n/static/3d4069744b600bd8595341dd29a472c8/a8a14/crochet-yarn-hook-size-whale-demonstration.jpg 885w,\n/static/3d4069744b600bd8595341dd29a472c8/fbd2c/crochet-yarn-hook-size-whale-demonstration.jpg 1180w,\n/static/3d4069744b600bd8595341dd29a472c8/1ab54/crochet-yarn-hook-size-whale-demonstration.jpg 4364w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>You could also just get the materials (listed below) and find a crochet pattern on the internet. I’d recommend finding a beginner pattern with a YouTube video, but have also listed YouTube videos I found helpful for all the basic techniques below.</p>\n<h2>Materials</h2>\n<p>These are the materials you need to make most projects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yarn (I started with acrylic Aran weight, before later being able to use the smaller cotton DK yarn - you can also scale up and use a bigger yarn and hook to make bigger versions)</li>\n<li>Crochet hook (I started witha 5.5mm with the heavier yarn, before later being able to use a 3.5mm or 3mm with the smaller yarn)</li>\n<li>A big blunt needle for sewing things together with yarn</li>\n<li>Something to mark your stitches (an earring or safety pin will do)</li>\n<li>6mm plastic safety eyes or black thread to make eyes</li>\n<li>Some stuffing</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>You can learn anything on YouTube</h2>\n<p>I used YouTube videos to learn every technique - but quality varies. These are the ones that worked for me:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yX0ZG4ef74\">Magic circle</a> - most patterns start with making a tiny circle of crochet called a “magic circle” because amigurumi is generally crocheted “in the round” - which means in a spiral (instead of in straight rows), with each batch of stitches being called a round</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RKVclxwLcQ\">Increasing into the magic circle</a> - how you make your second round of stitches after you’ve done the magic circle i.e. make the circle bigger, known as “increasing”</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/n48a4rdgxtU\">Invisible decrease</a> - how to neatly make the circle bigger, known as “decreasing</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/LxA2osb5Qfk\">Half double crochet stitch</a> - often used in making tiny arms or flippers or ears</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://clubcrochet.com/crochet-stripes-perfectly-amigurumi/\">Changing yarn colours</a> - contains a few different ways of doing it depending on how much effort you want to put in to make it neat</li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/how-to-crochet-tiny-animals-amigurumi/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to crochet tiny animals","date":"October 31, 2020","desc":"Notes on learning to make amigurumi from scratch.","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.8115942028985508,"src":"/static/eba8781a12630e316862dbc39565faf6/0f3a1/chonky-crochet-whales.jpg","srcSet":"/static/eba8781a12630e316862dbc39565faf6/1ada3/chonky-crochet-whales.jpg 125w,\n/static/eba8781a12630e316862dbc39565faf6/8f7df/chonky-crochet-whales.jpg 250w,\n/static/eba8781a12630e316862dbc39565faf6/0f3a1/chonky-crochet-whales.jpg 500w,\n/static/eba8781a12630e316862dbc39565faf6/f9913/chonky-crochet-whales.jpg 750w,\n/static/eba8781a12630e316862dbc39565faf6/a7715/chonky-crochet-whales.jpg 1000w,\n/static/eba8781a12630e316862dbc39565faf6/32841/chonky-crochet-whales.jpg 4378w","sizes":"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/how-to-crochet-tiny-animals-amigurumi/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/ada-lovelace-hashflag-emoji/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Designing the Ada Lovelace hashflag emoji"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/bio/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Bio"}}}},
