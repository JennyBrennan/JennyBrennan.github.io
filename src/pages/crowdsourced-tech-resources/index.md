I've successfully used Twitter to crowdsource resources for people getting into tech. This post documents the results (and saves me scrolling next time someone asks), as well as learnings from the process.

## Learning to code resources

I enjoy helping people learn to code, and have spent lots of time mentoring and teaching with organisations like [Code First: Girls](http://codefirstgirls.org.uk) and [23 Code Street](http://23codestreet.com). But that means *I'm* often people's first introduction to code - instead, I wanted to get an up-to-date idea of the best resources for people doing this **remotely**. So I turned to Twitter.

The ask:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey tech Twitter, what&#39;s your favourite online resource to recommend to someone who has never coded before (not even a tiny bit) and wants to see what it&#39;s about? <br><br>RT for reach 🙏 ✨</p>&mdash; Jenny Brennan (@jennyhbren) <a href="https://twitter.com/jennyhbren/status/939445849888821248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I was impressed by the results:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you for wonderful recommendations so far! Tl;dr:<br><br>⭐️ <a href="https://twitter.com/Codecademy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Codecademy</a> topping recommendations<br>⭐️ <a href="https://twitter.com/freeCodeCamp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@freeCodeCamp</a> next most popular<br><br>Honorable mentions:<br>🔸 <a href="https://twitter.com/codeorg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@codeorg</a> <br>🔸 <a href="https://twitter.com/MozDevNet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MozDevNet</a>: <a href="https://t.co/ENlbP4VQ9A">https://t.co/ENlbP4VQ9A</a><br>🔸 <a href="https://t.co/7Eztn3kre4">https://t.co/7Eztn3kre4</a><br>🔸 <a href="https://twitter.com/ftrain?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ftrain</a>&#39;s article: <a href="https://t.co/rwUYeToQff">https://t.co/rwUYeToQff</a> <a href="https://t.co/isicyjBMuU">https://t.co/isicyjBMuU</a></p>&mdash; Jenny Brennan (@jennyhbren) <a href="https://twitter.com/jennyhbren/status/939932589762195456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2017</a></blockquote>

A summary Tweet felt like a good way to:
* boost reach
* help people (including myself!) lost in all the replies
* thank people for their responses

I've also seen awesome examples of others doing this, including [Jessica Rose](https://twitter.com/jesslynnrose), who [does this regularly](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Ajesslynnrose%20tech%20twitter&src=typd) and inspired me in the first place:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tech Twitter: What are your fav low cost (or free!) tech conferences or events?<br><br>RT for reach? Really want to find which events are doing a great job on this 💸✨</p>&mdash; Jessica Rose (@jesslynnrose) <a href="https://twitter.com/jesslynnrose/status/1052226607656685568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

And more recently [Charlotte Fereday](https://twitter.com/CharlotteBRF) who used Twitter to very quickly gain a lot of contributors to her [Coder Newbie Advice GitHub Repository](https://github.com/charlottebrf/coder-newbie-advice):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Started a repo to help people who want to learn to code for free 3 days ago, with the hope it can help diversify tech. Blown away by support, already had 8 PRs. Pls keep RT-ing &amp; sharing so we can keep growing it: <a href="https://t.co/0UVQzjtvNl">https://t.co/0UVQzjtvNl</a> <a href="https://t.co/HmKadXvzIm">pic.twitter.com/HmKadXvzIm</a></p>&mdash; Charlotte Fereday (@CharlotteBRF) <a href="https://twitter.com/CharlotteBRF/status/1054848928896684032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2018</a></blockquote>

## Getting into cybersecurity

Cybersecurity isn't my expertise, but was the interest of a mentee of mine, so, again, I turned to Twitter.

The ask:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey tech Twitter, what resources/tips would you recommend to a 17yo who wants to get into cybersecurity?👩‍💻 Bonus points for online or UK-based. <br><br>RT for reach? Thank you 🙏 ✨</p>&mdash; Jenny Brennan (@jennyhbren) <a href="https://twitter.com/jennyhbren/status/949991497218383872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The response was fantastic: 120 replies, many detailed and thoughtful, some direct offers of support/conference tickets from senior industry people, and a notable subset who had assumed I was the 17 year old girl 💁. 

I didn't post a summary Tweet this time as the results were hugely diverse, and sometimes contradictory so I'd recommend working your way through them if cybersecurity's your thing.
